<p>They recently made a real life remake of the movie beauty and the beast. It was a good movie but they did change a couple of things that they shouldnt have. I didnt like the new changes.</p>

<p>Thats not the only movie they have remade to real life. They also made the cinderella movie a real life remake. I have not watched that movie yet. The movie for the most part has pretty high reviews.
